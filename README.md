Welcome, my name is Dmytro I am interested in everything tech and more. I mostly do digital electronics with microcontrollers/SoCs, 3D printing, and software development. Often I venture out of my comfort zone to learn something new, for example right now I am improving my analog and power electronics skills as well as learning FPGA development. If I have an internet connection and time I can pretty much make anything.
